# Getting Started with Create React Email

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs a development mode to run a local server, render the email, and watch for changes. When JS or CSS changes, it rebuilds and serves out of the `public` folder, and then triggers a live reload in your browser afterwards.

### `yarn build`

Builds the email for production to the `public` folder.
